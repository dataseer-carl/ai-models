A developer has identified houses in Melbourne that are about to be up for sale.

They have asked you to predict the price for these properties.

The ff files can be found in the working directory:

* `Day 2/Workshop - Housing/Data/melbourn-housing train.csv`: historical data on housing sale clearances
* `Day 2/Workshop - Housing/Data/melbourn-housing canshow.csv`: whitelist of *Addresses* with the same features included in the training dataset; does not include *Price*
* `Day 2/Workshop - Housing/Docs/doc00_data_dictionary.html`: data dictionary

> Send a csv-file containing your predictions to [`carl.calub@dataseer.com`](mailto:carl.calub@dataseer.com).  Don't forget to include your team name in the email.
>
> The csv-file should contain 270 rows and two (2) columns: the *Address* and the predicted price for that address.  A sample is provided in `Day 2/Workshop - Housing/Data/sample predictions.csv`
