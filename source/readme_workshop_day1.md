An insurance company has flagged customers who have filed auto insurance claims. However, the amounts of their claims have not yet been determined.

They have asked you to predict the total amount of claims for each of the customers in their whitelist.

The ff files can be found in the working directory:

* `Day 1/Workshop - Claims/Data/potential-claims training.csv`: historical data on claims made to be used for training the predictive model
* `Day 1/Workshop - Claims/Data/potential-claims for prediction.csv`: whitelist of *Customers* with the same features included in the training dataset; does not include *Total Claims Amount*
* `Day 1/Workshop - Claims/Docs/doc00_data_dictionary.html`: data dictionary

> Send a csv-file containing your predictions to [`carl.calub@dataseer.com`](mailto:carl.calub@dataseer.com).  Don't forget to include your team name in the email.
>
> The csv-file should contain 2,284 rows and two (2) columns: the *Customer ID* and the predicted total claim amount for that customer.  A sample is provided in `Day 1/Workshop - Claims/Data/sample predictions.csv`
